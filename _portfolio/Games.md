<p> This is the very first project of my UnderGraduate Study Life at CSE, BUET. As a part of our Level 1 Term 1 Project on Structured Programming Language (C), it was developed. We used iGraphics (OpenGL wrapper for the graphical demonstration). </p>

<p> This is a 2D Zombie-Shooting Game named Walking In The Dead. The goal is to shoot the attacker zombies and gain points to pass the levels. The details of the game and further instructions on Gameplay can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/asifelhan/Walking-In-The-Dead" style = "color:cyan;">GitHub Repository</a>. </p>
